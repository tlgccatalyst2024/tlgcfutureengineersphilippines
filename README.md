Engineering materials
====

This repository contains engineering materials of a self-driven vehicle's model participating in the WRO Future Engineers competition in the season 2022.

## Content

* `t-photos` contains 2 photos of the team (an official one and one funny photo with all team members)
* `v-photos` contains 6 photos of the vehicle (from every side, from top and bottom)
* `video` contains the video.md file with the link to a video where driving demonstration exists
* `schemes` contains one or several schematic diagrams in form of JPEG, PNG or PDF of the electromechanical components illustrating all the elements (electronic components and motors) used in the vehicle and how they connect to each other.
* `src` contains code of control software for all components which were programmed to participate in the competition
* `models` is for the files for models used by 3D printers, laser cutting machines and CNC machines to produce the vehicle elements. If there is nothing to add to this location, the directory can be removed.
* `other` is for other files which can be used to understand how to prepare the vehicle for the competition. It may include documentation how to connect to a SBC/SBM and upload files there, datasets, hardware specifications, communication protocols descriptions etc. If there is nothing to add to this location, the directory can be removed.

## Introduction

Constructing, Gathering, and Submitting the Code
oBuilding the Code: To develop our modules, we utilize the LEGO Mindstorms programming software, which lets us drag and drop building components. We can test and iterate faster thanks to this visual programming environment.
oCompiling the Code: To make sure there are no mistakes, we compile our code inside the software after it is finished. This stage verifies that every module functions as planned.
oUploading the Code: Lastly, we use Bluetooth or USB to link the car's controller to our PC. We directly upload the compiled code to the controller, enabling it to function during the WRO competition. We're excited to show off the effort we've put into our robot and are proud of its accomplishments! I'm grateful for your support, and letâ€™s make this competition a memorable experience!
